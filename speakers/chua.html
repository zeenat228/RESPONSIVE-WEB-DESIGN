			Amy Chua</h3> <br>

		<p>Amy Lynn Chua (born October 26, 1962), also known as "the Tiger Mom", is an American corporate lawyer, legal scholar, and writer. She is the John M. Duff Jr. Professor of Law at Yale Law School with an expertise in international business transactions, law and development, ethnic conflict, and globalization. She joined the Yale faculty in 2001 after teaching at Duke Law School for seven years. Prior to teaching, she was a corporate law associate at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton.</p>

		<p>Chua is also known for her parenting memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. In 2011, she was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people, one of The Atlantic's Brave Thinkers, and one of Foreign Policy's Global Thinkers.Chua has written five books: two studies of international affairs, a parenting memoir, a book on ethnic-American culture and its correlation with socio-economic success within the United States, and a book about the role of tribal loyalties in American politics and its foreign policy.</p>

		<p>Her first book, World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability (2003), explores the ethnic conflict caused in many societies by disproportionate economic and political influence of "market dominant minorities" and the resulting resentment in the less affluent majority. World on Fire, which was a New York Times bestseller, selected by The Economist as one of the Best Books of 2003,and named by Tony Giddens in The Guardian as one of the "Top Political Reads of 2003",examines how globalization and democratization since 1989 have affected the relationship between market-dominant minorities and the wider population.</p>

		<p>Chua is known for mentoring students from marginalized communities and for helping students get judicial clerkships. In 2018, HuffPost and The Guardian alleged that Chua had advised female students to dress "outgoing" when seeking employment. Chua denied this claim. In 2019, Chua agreed not to drink or socialize with students outside of class for a limited time.</p>
